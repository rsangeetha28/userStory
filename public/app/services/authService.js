//We can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app â€“ controllers, services, filters, directives, etc.
//Most applications have a main method that instantiates and wires together the different parts of the application.
//Angular apps don't have a main method. Instead modules declaratively specify how an application should be bootstrapped.

//The following line helps to create an angular service/application

//If you use a service you will get the instance of a function ("this" keyword).
//If you use a factory you will get the value that is returned by invoking the function reference (the return statement in factory).
